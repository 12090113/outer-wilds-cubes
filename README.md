Build things with Minecraft blocks on anything anywhere in the solar system.

On mouse and keyboard, place the blocks with left click, destroy them with alt+click, and switch blocks with T.
When using NomaiVR, place with interact, break with roll+interact, and switch with roll+grip.

Currently, this mod has 4 different types of blocks: cobblestone, dirt, oak planks, and iron blocks. You can add more by putting textures into the `blocks` folder, though they will default to the stone placing sound.
