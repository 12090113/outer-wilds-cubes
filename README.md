Build things with Minecraft blocks on anything anywhere in the solar system.

Mouse and keyboard:
- place the blocks with left click
- destroy them with alt+click
- switch blocks with T
- save all placed blocks with O
- load save (and delete unsaved blocks) with P

NomaiVR:
- place with interact
- break with roll+interact
- switch with roll+grip

Currently, this mod has 4 different types of blocks: cobblestone, dirt, oak planks, and iron blocks. You can add more by putting textures into the `blocks` folder, though they will default to the stone placing sound.

Your save (created by pressing O) is stored in `save.bin`. You can share this with other people to load into their game (by pressing P), but I think vendors (Steam/Epic/Xbox) might have slightly different versions of the game, so keep in mind some objects might not have blocks loaded on to them. Also, if you have added custom blocks (textures in the `blocks` folder), make sure to have all the same blocks as when the save was created, or some blocks won't be the right type.
